# Rapid_Inner_Core_Growth
How fast can Earth's inner core grow in from supercooled core liquids once nucleated?
Following ideas from https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-024-00639-6

Fred's code for rapid inner core growth.
test-profiles.pkl gives radial properties of the core from a prior thermal history as an example.
The thermodynamics comes from Walker et al., 2025 (https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2024.0505) which uses the model of Komabayashi 2014 (doi:10.1002/2014JB010980).
An example is given as both a python script and notebook ("IC_Growth_Example") and outputs to pickle files (example outputs also given here).
